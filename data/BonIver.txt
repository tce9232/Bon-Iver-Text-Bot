I am my mother's only one
It's enough
I wear my garment so it shows
Now you know
Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon
I am my mother on the wall
With us all
I move in water, shore to shore
Nothing's more
Only love is all maroon
Lapping lakes like leery loons
Leaving rope burns, reddish ruse
Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon
Sold my cold knot, a heavy stone
Sold my red horse for a venture home
To vanish on the bow
Settling slow
Fit it all, fit it in the doldrums
Or so the story goes
Color the era
Film it as historical
My mile could not pump the plumb
In my arbor 'till my ardor trumped
Every inner inertia
Lump sum
All at once rushing from the sump-pump
Or so the story goes
Balance we won't know
We will see when it gets warm
ome on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different "kind"
I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on skinny love what happened here
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted?
Then who the hell was I?
Now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?
Ooh, ooh
Someday my pain
Someday my pain will mark you
Harness your blame
Harness your blame, walk through
With the wild wolves around you
In the morning, I'll call you
Send it farther on
Solace my game
Solace my game, it stars you
Swing wide your crane
Swing wide your crane and run me through
And the story's all over you
In the morning, I'll call you
Can't you find a clue
When your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
Don't bother me
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
Ah, ah
Someday my pain
Someday my pain, my pain
Someday my pain
Someday my pain
Back down, down to the downtown
Down to the lockdown...
Boards, nails lie around
I crouch like a crow
Contrast in the snow
For the agony I'd rather know
'Cause blinded
I am blindsided
Peek in
Into the peer in
I'm not really like this
I'm probably plightless
I come through the window
I'm crippled and slow
For the agony I'd rather know
'Cause blinded
I am blindsided
Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out for me now?
Would you really rush out
Would you really rush out for me now?
Would you really rush out for me now?
Would you really rush out for me now?
Would you really rush out
For me now?
Ooh, for me now
Ooh, for me now
Ooh, for me now
Taut line
Down to the shoreline
The end of a blood line
The moon is a cold light
There's a pull to the flow
My feet melt the snow
For the irony I'd rather know
'Cause blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided
I was full by your count
I was lost but your fool
Was a long visit wrong?
Say you are the only
So many foreign worlds
So relatively fucked
So ready for us
So ready for us
The creature fear
I was teased by your blouse
Spit out by your mouth
I was loud by your lowered
Seminary soul
Tear on tail on
Take all on the wind on
The soft bloody nose
Sign another floor
The so many territories
Ready to reform
Don't let it form us
Don't let it form us
The creature fear
So did he foil his own?
Is he ready to reform?
So many torahs
So many for us
The creature fear
[Narrator:]
"So apropos
Saw death on a sunny snow"
[Him:]
"For every life..."
[Her:]
"forego the parable."
[Him:]
"Seek the light."
[Her:]
"...my knees are cold."
Running home
Running home
Running home
Running home

"Go find another lover;
To bring a- to string along!"
"With all your lies,
You're still very lovable."
"I toured a light
So many foreign roads
For Emma, forever ago."
This my excavation and today is Qumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain
This is paralyzed
I keep throwing it down two-hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone
And you're drunk as hell
On your back with your racks as the stacks are your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load
Well I've been twisting to the sun and the moon
I needed to replace
The fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down
In a frozen ground
There's a black crow sitting across from me
His wiry legs are crossed
He is dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be
That has brought me to this loss?
On your back with your racks as the stacks are your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load
This is not the sound of a new man or crispy realization
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
Your love will be
Safe with me
You ride in the park and you're peeking
Piss pools in your seat
She's standing inside, but you surely repeat
Oh, God, don't leave me here
I will freeze till the end
Love is love's reprieve
Winter is coming and you're stacking
All your summer sheets
Now when the wind blows you cover your teeth
And our tool shed where you trade in your blues
Love is love's sad news
That was Wisconsin that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go I take another place with me
Love is love's mystique
You're up on the bar and you're shaking
With every grimy word
Who will you love
What's love when you've hurt
Wherever is your scene the snow kissed the curb
Love is love's return
That was Wisconsin that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go I take another place with me
Love is love's critique
Well, I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags
You said, "See look at it: that's yours
Stacked on top with your brother's.
See how they resemble one another's
Even in their plastic little covers."
And I said, "I know it well.
That secret that you know that you don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor and it teases your head
But you know that it's good, girl
'Cause it's running you with red."
Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both my hands
Chewing on a candy bar
You said, "Ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this?
As the moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss
And I said, "I know it well.
That secret that we know that we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor, I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs, babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?"
And I know it well, I know it well
And I know it well, I know it well
And I know it well, I know it well
And I know it well, I know it well
When you're out tell your lucky one
To know that you'll leave
Don't you lock when you're fleeing
I'd like not to hear keys
Only hold till your coffee warms
But don't hurry and speed
Once a time put a tongue in your ear on the beach
And you clutched clinging heels
Summer comes to multiply, to multiply
Summer comes to multiply, to multiply
And I, I'm the carnival of peace
I'll probably start a fleet with no apologies
And the carnival of scenes, it grows more and more appealing
But my woman and I, my woman and I know what we're for
Summer comes to multiply, to multiply
Summer comes to multiply, to multiply
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm tearing up, acrost your face
Move dust through the light
To fide your name
It's something fane
This is not a place
Not yet awake, I'm raised of make
Still alive who you love
Still alive who you love
Still alive who you love
In a mother, out a moth
Furling forests for the soft
Gotta know been lead aloft
So I'm ridding all your stories
What I know, what it is, is pouring – wire it up!
You're breaking your ground
Armour let it through, borne the arboretic truth you kept posing
Sat down in the suit, fixed on up it wasn't you by finished closing
Ramble in the roots, had the marvel, moved the proof be knee-led fine's glowing
Storing up the clues, it had it's sullen blue bruised through by showing
Settle past a patience where wishes and your will are spilling pictures
Water's running through in the valley where we grew to write this scripture:
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Not for a part in any gamut of the dark
Doubled in the toes annex it, it minute closed in the morning
Did not lose it in the stack's stow, I'm a lay that call back on ya
You know it won't beseech you, we're laying in an open field
I will let you grow, no need to know this
So carry on my dear, what is clear up in the daylight is we're hung here
Fall is coming soon, a new year for the moon and the Hmong here
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
All that it seems
Bellows tracing through the streams
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
All at it's seams
Swallows swelling for the beams
"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me."
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend,
It's on its head,
It struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet
... and at once I knew I was not magnificent
Strayed above the highway aisle
(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles
3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me
... and at once I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
(Jagged, vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles
Christmas night,
It clutched the light,
The hallow bright
Above my brother,
I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make
It what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory:
... and at once I knew I was not magnificent
High above the highway aisle
(Jagged vacance, thick with ice)
I could see for miles, miles, miles
For the love, Iʼd fallen on
in the swampy August dawn
what a mischief you would bring young darling!
when the onus is not all your own
when you’re up for it before you’ve grown
from the faun forever gone
in the towers of your honeycomb
I’d a tore your hair out just to climb back darling
when you’re filling out your only form
can you tell that itʼs just ceremon’
now you’ve added up to what you’re from
build your tether rain-out from your fragments…
break the sailor’s table on your sacrum…
fuck the fiercest fables, I’m with Hagen
for the love, comes the burning young
from the liver, sweating through your tongue
well, youʼre standing on my sternum don’t you climb down darling
oh the sermons are the first to rest
smoke on Sundays when youʼre drunk and dressed
out the hollows where the swallow nests
I was unafraid, I was a boy, I was a tender age
melic in the naked, knew a lake and drew the lofts for page
hurdle all the waitings up, know it wasn’t wedded love
4 long minutes end and it was over it’d all be back
and the frost took up the eyes
pressed against the pane could see the veins and there was poison out
resting in a raze the inner claims I hadn’t breadth to shake
searching for an inner clout, may not take another bout
honey in the hale could fill the pales of loving less with vain
hon, it wasn’t yet the spring
aiming and it sunk and we were drunk and we had fleshed it out
nose up in the globes, you never know if you are passing out
no it wasn’t maiden-up, the falling or the faded luck
hung up in the ivory, both were climbing for a finer cause
love can hardly leave the room
with your heart
(Fall in
fall out
fall along)
in the first of light
past the Noachide
bodies wrapped in white
stranded every pain
baby, pasts are slain
“I got outta La Grange…”
in Hinnom
all this time
with your heart in mind
didn’t you edit
in Hinnom
go, the least
and the precious feast
the in-vetted
sand it starts to steal
dirt and ice imbed in cheeks
in the potter’s field
solar peace
well it swirls and sweeps
you just set it
strangers scattering
nether passage in the wind
off pennant tension ring
armor, down
on the wettest ground
not to vet it
Climb
Is all we know
When thaw
Is not below us
No, can't grow up
In that iron ground
Claire, all too sore for sound
Bet
Is hardly shown
Scraped
Across the foam
Like they stole it
And oh, how they hold it
Claire, we nearly forfeit
I'm growing like the quickening hues
I'm telling darkness from lines on you
Over havens fora full and swollen morass, young habitat!
All been living alone, where the ice snap and the hold clast are known
Home
We're savage high
Come
We finally cry
Oh and we don it
Because it's right
Claire, I was too sore for sight
We're sewing up through the latchet greens
Un-peel keenness, honey, bean for bean
Same white pillar tone as with the bone street sand is thrown where she stashed us at
All been living alone, where the cracks at in the low part of the stoning
Don't you cherish me to sleep
Never keep your eyelids clipped
Hold me for the pops and clicks
I was only for the father's crib
Hair, old, long along
Your neck onto your shoulder blades
Always keep that message taped
Cross your breasts you won't erase
I was only for your very space
Hip, under nothing
Propped up by your other one, face 'way from the sun
Just have to keep a dialogue
Teach our bodies: haunt the cause
I was only trying to spell a loss
Joy, it's all founded
Pincher with the skin inside
You pinned me with your black sphere eyes
You know that all the rope's untied
I was only for to die beside
So itʼs storming on the lake
Little waves our bodies break
There's a fire going out,
But there's really nothing to the south
Swollen orange and light let through
Your one piece swimmer stuck to you
Sold, I'm Ever
Open ears and open eyes
Wake up to your starboard bride
Who goes in and then stays inside
Oh the demons come, they can subside
Errant heat to the star
And the rain let in
The hawser rolls, the vessel’s whole and Christ, it’s thin
Well Iʼd know that you’d offer
Would reveal it, though it’s soft and flat
Won’t repeat it, cull and coffer’s that
For the soffit, hang this homeward
Pry it open with your love
Sending lost and alone standing offers
It is steep / it is stone
Such recovery
From the daily press, the deepest nest, in keeper’s keep
All the news at the door
Such a revelry
Well, it’s hocked inside of everything you said to me
It was found what we orphaned
Didn’t mention it would serve us picked
Said your love is known
I’m standing up on it
Aren’t we married?!
I ainʼt living in the dark no more
It’s not a promise, Iʼm just gonna call it
Heavy mitted love
Our love is a star
Sure some hazardry
For the light before and after most indefinitely
Danger has been stole away
This is axiom
It might be over soon, soon, soon
Where you gonna look for confirmation?
And if it's ever gonna happen
So as I'm standing at the station
It might be over soon
(All these years)
There I find you marked in constellation (two, two)
There isn't ceiling in our garden
And then I draw an ear on you
So I can speak into the silence
It might be over soon (two, do, two)
It might be over soon (two, do, two)
(Two, do, two, two, do, two)
(It might be over soon)
(Two, do, two, two, do, two)
(It might be over soon)
(And I'm gonna shout all my trouble over)
Oh and I have carried consecration
And then you expelled all decision
As I may stand up with a vision
Caught daylight, goddamn right
Within our eyes there lies a scission
(It might be over soon)
Fe, fever rest
Fever rest
(Wild heart, wild heart)
I cut you in
Deafening
Fever rest
(Darling didn't love right)
I've been sleeping in a stable, mate
Not gonna do you no favors
What I got is seen you trying
Or take it down the old lanes around
Fuckified
Darling don't make love, fight it
Love, don't fight it
Love, don't fight it
Love...
Well I'll wrap you up
And I take it by the touch
Darling don't a failure fright
Times the raker
And I'll rack it up
I'm unorphaned in our northern lights
Dedicoding every daemon
Taken in the tall grass of the mountain cable
And I cannot seem to find I'm able
Down along the creek
I remember something
Her, the heron hurried away
When first I breeched that last Sunday
Low moon don the yellow road
I remember something
That leaving wasn't easing
All that heaving in my vines
And as certain it is evening 'at is now is not the time
Ooh
Toiling with your blood
I remember something
In B, unrationed kissing on a night second to last
Finding both your hands as second sun came past the glass
And oh, I know it felt right and I had you in my grasp
Oh, then how we gonna cry
Cause it once might not mean something
Love, a second glance it is not something that we'll need
Honey, understand that I have been left here in the reeds
But all I'm trying to do is get my feet out from the crease
And I'll see you
Turn around, you're my A-Team
Turn around now, you're my A-Team
God damn, turn around now, you're my A-Team
(When we leave this room it's gone)
Is the company stalling?
We had what we wanted: your eyes
(When we leave this room it's gone)
With no word from the former
I'd be happy as hell, if you stayed for tea
(I know so well that this is all there is)
This is how we grow now, woman
A child ignored
These will just be places to me now
The foreman is down
(When we leave this room it's gone)
We're rising the stairs
We find God and religions to
Staying at the Ace Hotel
If the calm would allow
Then I would just be floating to you now
It would make me pass to let it pass on
I'm climbing the dash, that skin
(Here in this room, this narrow room where life began when we were young last night)
Well we walked up on that bolt in the street
After you tied me in in the driveway of the apartment of his bede
Sent your sister home in a cab
Said I woulda walked across any thousand lands
(No not really if you can't)
I didn't need you that night
Not gonna need you anytime
Was gonna take it as it goes
I could go forward in the light
Well I better fold my clothes
(I'll be looking through your eyes)
All my goodness
(I'll be looking through your eyes)
(I'll be looking through your eyes)
All my goodness to show
(Why are you so far from saving me?)
(Why are you so far from saving me?)
Sharing smoke
In the stair up off the hot car lot
Sun shine hard on the video spot
Hm, mm, mm, mm
Sure as any living dream
It's not all then what it seems
And the whole thing's hauled away
A womb
An empty robe
Enough
You're rolling up
You're holding it
You're fabric now
Paramind
Paramind
Hallucinating Claire
Nor the snow shoe light or the autumns
Threw the meaning out the door
(Now could you be a friend)
There's no meaning anymore
(Come and kiss me here again)
A womb
An empty robe
Enough
You're rolling up
You're holding it
You're bent prize
Canonize
Canonize
Motor up and yeah, you're own, ooh
And yeah, you're on your own, ooh
Fold the map and mend the gap
And I tow the word companion
And I make my self escape
Oh, the multitude of other
It comes always off the page
I hold the note
You wrote and know
You've buried all your alimony butterflies
Sub find
Some night
Sixes hang in the door
What kind of shit to ignore
I've cut the cloth
(Ooo, hard line circle)
How to know who to write
How to know who can cull up all the questions
(We know that I'm right, cease)
To clean out a night
I fell in love
I heard about it
I heard about it
I heard about it
No
And so it's not in your clasp
What's the function or the task
Well, I'd stun and I'd stammer
Help me reach the hammer
(For then what will I ask)
That's a pair of them docks
Mooring out two separate lochs
Ain't that some kind of quandary
Take me into your palms
What is left when unhungry
I learned about it
I learned about it
I've learned about it
No
I'm still standing in
Still standing in the need of the prayer
The need of prayer
No, I don't know the path
Or what kind of pith I've amassed
Long lines of questions
Lessons (lessons)
Lessons, lessons
What do you lose to concede?
And yes it's hard to believe
When 'em sold from your sleeve
Just come off of your kneel
Please, please, please
I can admit to conceal
No, that's not how that's supposed to feel
Oh, no
(It's not for broader appeal)
Fuck the fashion of it, dear
I've laughed about it
I've laughed about it
I've laughed about it
No
The math ahead
The math behind it
It's moon water
The math ahead
The math behind
Moon water
Remomrize numb
And half the hum
For moon water
I'd hide Berlin
To run and find it
Moon water
The path ahead
The path behind it
It's moon water
Philosophize your figure
What I have and haven't held
You called and I came, stayed tall through it all
Fall and fixture just the same thing
Say nothing of my fable, no
What on earth is left to come
Who's agonized and gnawed through it all
I'm underneath your tongue
I'm standing in your street now, no
And I carry his guitar
And I can't recall it lightly at all
But I know I'm going in
Too much for me to pick up, no
Not sure what forgiveness is
We've galvanized at the squall of it all
I can leave behind the harbour
I will run
(All around it)
Have to crawl
(Still can't stop it)
Along the fires
One more time just pass me by
Imma make it half the night
Hall light wishes
To walk aside your favor
I'm an Astuary King
I'll keep in a cave your comfort and all
Unburdened and becoming
I will run (all around it) (sailing off and on you're on your honor)
Have to crawl (still can't stop it) (carry off and up your seize)
Along the fires
Carry up love along unfettered time
Now, Mona
Haven't I locked up my failures (sailing off and on you're on your honor)
(From the core to the sky)
Wouldn't I be last to see? (carry off and up your seize)
(From the door till we die)
Deny with love my labour (carry up with love a long)
Atonements defined (was it all I could find?) (we live outside)
Keep waking up high
Well I've been carved in fire
Well I've been caught in fire
I've been caught in fire, whaaaa
Well I've been caught in fire
I've been carved in fire
I've been caught in fire
What comes prior to?
I've been caught in fire
I stayed down the other night
I've been caught in fire
I stayed down
(Without knowing what the truth is)
I've been caught in fire
I stayed down the other night
I've been caught in fire
I stayed down
(Without knowing what the truth is)
Fire
(Fire)
Must've been forces, that took me on them wild courses
Who knows how many poses, that I've been in
But them the main closest, hark! it gives meaning Mine
I cannot really post this, ah feel the signs
I worried about rain and I worried bout lightning
But I watched them off, to the light of the morning
Marking the slope, slung low in the highlands
Where the days have no numbers
If it's harmed, it's harmed me, it'll harm, I let it in
Oh, the old modus: out to be leading live
Said, comes the old ponens, demit to strive
A word about Gnosis: it ain't gonna buy the groceries
Or middle-out locusts, or weigh to find
I worry about shame, and I worry bout a worn path
And I wander off, just to come back home
Turning to waltz, hold high in the lowlands
Cause the days have no numbers
It harms me, it harms me, it harms like a lamb
So I can depose this, partial to the bleeding vines
Suppose you can't hold shit. how high I've been
What a river don't know is: to climb out and heed a line
To slow among roses, or stay behind
I've been to that grove
Where no matter the source is
And I walked it off: how long I'd last
Sore-ring to cope, whole band on the canyon
Cause the days have no numbers
Well it harms it harms me it harms, I'll let it in
An easy swing had its time shouldered
Slow bending axe
Now it's a photo framed
The swing hasn't had it
And here we are rebuilding roads
Right by roosting towns
It's just like the love
The one that's never been enough
So I'm counting on your fingers
'Cause you've reattached the twitch
And if you want opinion
I will die along the ditches
And every summer is a hot token
To the cold, cold take of lust
And every autumn singes
With the business of sadness
Friend had it wrong they see
Honey let it burn
And the curve in the county
Is never served
So I'm counting on your fingers
'Cause you've reattached the twitch
And if you want opinion
I will die along the ditches
All my life
Ini was
Ooh, mine was a lover of a wrong kind
Keeping what you telling me
I know mine
Living in a lonesome way
Had me looking other ways
'Cause I am, I am, I am lost here, again
But on a bright fall morning, I'm with it
I stood a little while within it
Man, you have to know
Know the way
It goes, it goes, it goes
I am, I am, I am, I am
It goes, It goes
I am, I am, I am, I am
If forgiveness is a chore
What you waiting for?
We been here before
And I can't ignore it anymore
You know the way it goes
How much longer then? (I'll show you in)
(Now I'll tell you why)
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
Ain't no say what I do in
Every day say they don't like it, I say
"Hey, don't like it", I say
"Hey, don't like it", I say
"Hey, don't like it", I say
"Hey, don't like it", I say
If that ain't just the truth
I am, I am, I am, I am
I like you, I like you
And that ain't nothing new
And if it don't happen like that
Well, then it don't happen at all
Keepin' what you tell me
(Said Ini)
Now I won't lie
For only takers, stand and take in where you are
Turn around and face it, you're adjacent to the scar
"I want mine here though"
We heard that story before (Woo, hahaha)
What you think we're taming with the towers and the oar?
You keep evading boy, you putting me flat on the floor
It's okay, you were young when you were gave it
But you stayed there
And you’d expect it when we photograph our scars
Some lonely fable that we took in then right from the start
I want it back
I want it back
Won’t you tell me how to get it back?
I want it back
I want it back
Why won't you tell me how to get it back?
My, my, my, my
I'm coming over for another story told
I'm saying homie that it's not what you been sold
It's hardly what you'd know
The ordinary something neither of us holds
No folding gold for protecting from the lords
Who's that really we leave out in the cold?
But they're depending, so you just keep giving pause
"I must defend it", oh, the tariffs hit you hard
Just keep adding up boy, you'll be below regard
Danger been stepping in
I'm happy as I ever been
Couldn’t tell ya what the cadence is
It's folded in the evidences
So you wanna leave a mark?
You're honing in on Meadow Park?
I heard you guys are very safe
Caught up with the featherweights
The dawn is rising
The land ain't rising
No, no, no
Flash hope
Pass the throw
Coming in very late
Just above our pay grades
You ask me not to pull alarms
We have to act our ages
The dawn is rising
But the land ain't rising
No, no, no
Catch up
You wanna go the fast way?
Bonded weights
Don't favor them
If it's all that you don't do
It's lacerate
Better let them pass away
Stay, go?
Better that you find a new way
Before my eyes
Couldn't learn it any other way
By the way
I waited outside
I took it remote
I wanted a bath
"Tell the story or he goes"
"Tell the story or he goes"
Full time, you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time to call your Ma
Hey Ma, hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well, you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light
I waited outside
I was tokin' on dope
I hoped it all wunt go in a minute
With the past that you know
I wanted all that mind sugar
I want it all mine
I had a heavy mind, sugar
It took it, it was right
Full time, you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time to call your Ma
Hey Ma, hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well, you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light
You're back and forth
You're back and forth
You go back and forth
And then you're back and forth
And back and forth
I waited outside
Then you took me in the room
And you offered up the truth
My eyes crawling up the window to the wall
From dusk 'til dawn
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em all
Full time, you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time to call your Ma
Hey Ma, hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well, you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light
Mmm, mmm
I will see you off now
Down the back of the ridge
There's just something that I got to show you
There is domer and there's rot
And the common case
It ain't nothing what you say is true
With your long arms, try
And just give some time
Presently, it does include my dues
Ain't your standard premonitions
All this phallic repetition
Boy, you tell yourself a tale or two
Man like you
Man, improve
Well, I know that we set off for a common place
(And the lines have run too deep)
How much caring is there of some American love
When there's lovers sleeping in your streets?
So Cerberus Ride
Bring those dead alive
Like Pirate Jenny on the Black Freighter
It'll be a long day of fixing
Make something else your mission
Boy, why this shit's so hard to cue?
Man like you
How you do?
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Hey
More love
More love
More love
All along 'em I can hear me
I go for the caste
I fall off a bass boat
And the concrete's very slow
And the concrete's very slow
All along the sideline's bigger
I'm over the dash
I'm having a bad, bad toke
But the berries still to come
All along them I can hear ya
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying (I can hear)
I can hear cry (Crying)
I can hear, I can hear (Crying)
I can hear, I can hear crying
(I can hear, I can hear)
All along me I can hear you
I'd occupy that
Can't sit back long while you're forming that
Oh my mind our kids got bigger
But I'm climbing down the bastion now
You take me out to pasture now
Well, I won't be angry long
Well, I can't be angry long
We burnt up in my bed
Standing on the mattress, Laul
Laul, can't we just patch this up?
And I cannot seem to carry it all
All along we I can hear me
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying (I can hear)
I can hear cry (Crying)
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
All around me I can hear 'em
So what is gonna happen now?
If you don't look away
What's there to pontificate on now?
There's someone in my head
Tell them I'll be passing on
Tell them we're young mastodons
And it can't be that it's all
And it can't be that it's all
I'm telling you that I do feel ya
It's suddenly paths, mama
It ain't about class, mama
And it won't be very long
Oh, it won't be very long
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
(I can hear)
I can hear (Crying)
I can hear, I can hear (Crying, crying)
I can hear
(I can hear crying)
(Crying, crying)
Well, angel, morning Sivanna
Well, ain't been gone too far
But heading out towards Ponoma
Where you won't be alone
Where there's thrift store manager in a poke camadee
And a gas mask on his arm
And one by one by one
We'll all be gone
We'll all be gone by the fall
We'll all be gone by the falling light
Brick layer
With a hat down on his feet
I'll say no more
I won't lead no Calvary
How long
Will you disregard the heat?
Half beat
It's no misnomer though
I've the feeling that I better go
So
I slide right out the door, oh
Shattered in history
Shattered in paint
Oh, and the lengths that I'd
Stay up late
But brought to my space
The wonderful things I’ve learned to waste
I should've known
That I shouldn't hide
To compromise and to covet
All what’s inside
There is no design
You'll have to decide
If you'll come to know, I'm the faithful kind
Time and again
(Got all that I need)
It's time to be brave
Content to the phrases
That at dawn, we ain't mazes
Just some kind of pages
This for my sister
That for my maple
It's not going the road I'd known as a child of God
Nor to become stable
(So what if I lose? I’m satisfied)
Am I dependent in what I’m defending?
And do we get to hold what faith provides?
Fold your hands into mine
I did my believing
Seeing every time
I know it's lonely in the dark
And this year’s a visitor
And we have to know that faith declines
I'm not all out of mine
Well, I thought that this was half a love
Well, I thought that this was half a love, love
Follow to the rising sea
Well, I thought that this was half a love
Well, I thought that this was half a love
Well, I thought that this was half a love
Follow to the rising sea
Well, I thought that this was half a love
Whoo
When I'm falling to the right
Salem burns the leaves
Then she
Returns to cure and see
Heavy fate
After years of waiting
'Cause abnormalities
Surely
Are everywhere you see
So what I think we need
Is elasticity, empowerment and ease
So I won't lead no lie
With our hearts the only matter why
How long it's lasted
I've not received reciprocity
To speak supportively
Big guy
There's no automatic peace
But I bet you'd keep
All these in-betweens that bar my youth
There's no anorberic dream
Far as I know
I tried too hard to see
What I thought it’d be
Asking constantly
How's it gonna be?
So I'm gonna weep a while
You don't even know how hard
I learned a lesson
Don't ask me, I've
Torn the banner from the line
Well, you find the time
Don't you
For the Lord?
But you can find the time
Oh, can't pass it around?
Fever last too long
Fever's rashing on
There's no fountain in silver
How art?
How art?
How often ya gonna see now
Truly what ya cease to be
Will you adjust your scenery?
Well, you find the time don’t you
For the Lord?
Keep it rational
Keep it rational
There's no fountain
If you wait, it won't be undone
Well, it's all just scared of dying
But isn't this a beach?
And if I know one thing at all
Is I cannot just be a peach
Oh, you come in all woke now
So, please enjoy the feast
We are weightless like a wayless beast
So what is it we don't teach?
When we were children we were hell-bent
Or oblivious at least
But now it comes to mind
We are terrified
So we run and hide
For a verified little peace
So what of this release?
Sun light feels good now, don't it?
And I don't have a leaving plan
But something's gotta ease your mind
But it's all fine, or it's all crime anyway
There were six of us sitting creek side
Sifting fistfuls through the green
Every which way could be seen
Was the sand and time
Not a pantomime
More like anodyne
Was a friend of mine
You'da known, you'da known
I could prophet
I could rob I, however
Everywhere isn’t everywhere
This is not a veil
Or a fairy tale in the least
So what of this release?
Some life feels good now, don't it?
(I think I need it)
Don't have to have a leaving plan
(Have to let it)
Nothing's gonna ease your mind
Well, it's all fine and we're all fine anyway
But if you wait, it won't be undone
